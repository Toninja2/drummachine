# Drum Machine
This messy 2020 (April, June) project is a drum machine where you can create rythms by make sounds automatically play at a specific timecode.

## Functionalities
Rythms are downloadable locally and savable in the cloud.  

This project includes a context menu on the drum machine with:  
- "Tempo": custom tempo at the time where click was done
- "Remove tempo": remove a custom tempo placed where the click was done
- "Start here": start the rythm where the click was done
- "Copy": copy sounds for an asked length
- "Paste": if copied sounds -> paste them
- "Master volume": general volume for the whole rythm
- "Delete this time"
